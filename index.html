        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various fields. Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving certain goals, which include the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. However, there is extensive debate regarding its exact nature beyond these general features. Some theorists view education primarily as a process that occurs during educational events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.[6][7][2] Others perceive it not as a process but as the product resulting from this process, emphasizing the mental states and dispositions of educated persons.[6][7][2] Additionally, the term may also refer to an academic field that studies the methods, processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and learning.[7] The term "education" is derived from the Latin words educare, meaning "bring up, rear, educate", primarily related to the mind, and educere, meaning "bring out, lead forth", and refers to the bodily level.

For example, they may claim that socialization is the aim of education. This means that education is seen as the process of transmitting accumulated knowledge from one generation to the next. This process helps the student to function in society as a regular citizen. More person-centered definitions focus on the well-being of the student instead. For them, education is a process that helps them lead a good life or the life they wish to lead. Various scholars stress critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. For them, mere indoctrination is only interested in instilling beliefs in the student
